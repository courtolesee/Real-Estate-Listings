# Real Estate Listings App

## Description
This app was built collaboratively during week 4 Prime's of onsite Trifid cohort by a small group. Duration: 1.5 days.

The Real Estate Listings App was built from the ground up to accomodate real estate agents or real estate companies' listing needs for both rentals and properties for sale. The user can sort by either type or view all. The user can input new properties or rentals by selecting the type, entering the city, price and square footage, and choosing a stock photo. The 'Featured Homes' section selects the 5 lowest priced properties for all, for sale only, or for rent only. The listings display in card format. 

## To Use
Create a database called `real_estate`. You will need import the `listings.sql` file into your database. In order to do this, you will need to create a `listings` table with a `CREATE TABLE "listings"` command. Look at the `INSERT` statements to determine which columns should be added to this table. Be sure to add your `CREATE TABLE` query to the `database.sql` file so that we can see how you did it.
